# Interface
Website based interface. Built using styled compenents and React.js.

### Landing Page
Simple introduction to the project.

### FAQ Page
Frequently asked questions. 

### Lookup Page
Recipe lookup page. Can try int values to search food, or cuisine type.

Try: "Mexican", "American" or "Chinese"

Try: "1000", "300", or "700"

### Database Simulation Page
Simulates the commands of what a database does using a list of created recipes. Like CREATE, READ, UPDATE, SELECT, and DELETE. 

# TODO 

### Write to file
The recipe data is now in a seperate file -> Data.js; however, we need to make it write to a csv file so it can keep its changes

### Add more commands
More read commands in the reference page

# Test Cases
Only two test cases so far, but it took a while to setup jest. Frankly the best way I could describe setting up the tests would be considering it a "movie".
