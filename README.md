# Running the Project
npm install, npm install express, npm install shortid

# Interface
Website based interface

### Landing Page
Simple introduction to the project. Everything is implemented with JavaScript and the ReactJS library. 

### FAQ Page
Frequently asked questions. Overall it looks pretty handsome. 

### Reference Page
The user has instructions where they can simulate the recipe database. We recently added a lot more recipes so it looks pretty handsome. We are working on more commands for this page. But just like the path to success it is always under construction. 

# TODO 

### Write to file
The recipe data is now in a seperate file -> Data.js; however, we need to make it write to a csv file so it can keep its changes

### Add more commands
More read commands in the reference page

### Create recipe cards
When a user clicks on a recipe from the reference page, it goes to another page with a handsome card of the recipe

# Test Cases
Only manual input so far. Hoping to have this done soon. When the time is right.
